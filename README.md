üöÄ Hotel Review Microservices Project
This project implements a Hotel Review System using a microservices architecture. It enables users to search for hotels, leave reviews, and view aggregated reviews for hotels via different microservices. It uses Spring Boot, Eureka for service discovery, MongoDB for data persistence, and REST APIs for communication between services.
